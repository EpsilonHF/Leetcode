"""
You are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2 
where nums1â€™s elements are subset of nums2. Find all the next 
greater numbers for nums1's elements in the corresponding 
places of nums2.

The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first 
greater number to its right in nums2. If it does not exist, 
output -1 for this number.

Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2].
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation:
For number 4 in the first array, you cannot find the next 
greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
For number 1 in the first array, the next greater number for 
it in the second array is 3.
For number 2 in the first array, there is no next greater 
number for it in the second array, so output -1.
